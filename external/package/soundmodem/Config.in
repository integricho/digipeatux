	  The source code is the latest available version on archive.org
	  Some patches were borrowed from the debian package (versioned as
	  0.20-5), while the rest were added mainly to allow
	  cross-compilation and to drop the dependency on gtk (which also
	  disables the gui configuration tool).

	  The init script will explicitly reference this path when starting
	  the soundmodem service.
