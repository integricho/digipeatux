# digipeatux setup guide

digipeatux is a minimalistic embedded Linux system for setting up APRS digipeaters and/or internet gateways, based on [Buildroot](https://buildroot.org/). It is a highly constrained system that contains only the bare minimum needed to to run an APRS digipeater on a specific set of hardware components and nothing else.

Refer to the [setup guide](https://github.com/integricho/digipeatux-setup-guide/) for instructions on how to build and deploy a digipeater.

## Credits

_digipeatux_ came to life from the idea of SÃ¼li Dalibor (DL7ORE / YU7ORE). Without his contributions, the project wouldn't have seen the light of day.
